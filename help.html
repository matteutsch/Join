              Join is a project management system that allows real-time
              collaboration between users and coworkers with a visual system
              used to manage and keep track of work as it moves through a
              process. It uses boards to provide an overview of the existing
              work situation and help improve communication and overall
              effectiveness. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential
              bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can flow through
              it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput.

            <h1>How to use it</h1>
            <!-- <br/> -->
            <h3>
              Here are some general guidelines on how to use a Kanban board:
            </h3>
            <p>
              Define your workflow: The first step in setting up a Kanban board
              is to define your workflow. This could involve breaking down a
              larger project into smaller tasks, or identifying the stages of a
              manufacturing process. Once you have identified the stages, you
              can create columns on the Kanban board to represent each stage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Visualize your tasks: Next, you need to write down each task on a
              separate card or sticky note and place them on the board in the
              appropriate column. This helps to create a visual representation
              of your workflow and allows you to see all of your tasks at a
              glance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Limit work in progress: One of the key principles of Kanban is to
              limit the amount of work in progress (WIP) at any given time. This
              helps to prevent bottlenecks and ensures that tasks are completed
              in a timely manner. To implement this principle, you can set a WIP
              limit for each column on the board. For example, if you have a "To
              Do" column, you might set a WIP limit of 5 tasks. This means that
              you can't start any new tasks until one of the existing tasks is
              completed and moved to the next column.
            </p>
            <p>
              Monitor progress: As tasks are completed, they should be moved to
              the next column on the board. This helps to track progress and
              identify any tasks that are stuck or taking longer than expected.
              You can also use metrics such as cycle time (the time it takes to
              complete a task) and throughput (the number of tasks completed per
              unit of time) to monitor progress and identify areas for
              improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Continuously improve: Finally, Kanban is all about continuous
              improvement. As you use the board and gather data, you should be
              looking for ways to optimize your workflow and improve efficiency.
              This could involve making changes to the board itself (e.g. adding
              or removing columns), or experimenting with different processes or
              tools to see what works best for your team. By following these
              guidelines, you can use a Kanban board to manage workflow, track
              progress, and continuously improve your processes.
